1) to fix displaying of 'File not found' screen when LogIn/SignUp/Profile/Details pages are refreshed or opened in the new tab/window
2) to prohibit selecting incorrect birth date values on SignUp page (e.g., February 31) - a warning message can be displayed after selecting
3) to prohibit using inner spaces inside username/password values
4) to prohibit using non-latin (e.g., cyrillic) characters in username/password/email(after @) values
5) to prohibit using only special characters in username/password/name values
6) to prohibit using only numeric characters in email(after @) values
7) to increase required field length for password
8) to ignore leading/trailing spaces when comparing filled values (e.g., now "admin" and "admin " are considered different usernames)
9) to ignore upper/lower case when comparing username values (e.g., now "admin" and "Admin" are considered different usernames)
